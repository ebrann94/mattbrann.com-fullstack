This is a website built to showcase a photographers portfolio.

The backend runs an express server. This servers serves a number of static files such as images and scripts but also renders html files from handlebars files. 

There is also an admin section to the website. This is password protected and provides a way for the client to upload images to the server and create new pages on the website.
The admin section is built using react as there is lots of changing data.
